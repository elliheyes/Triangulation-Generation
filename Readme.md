# FRST Triangulation Generation

In this package we use a deep Q-learning reinforcement learning model to generate fine regular star triangulations of reflexive polytopes. These triangulations provide resolutions to non-terminal singularities in the ambient toric Fano variety and Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces constructed from the polytope. One can also look for added geometric information, such as fibration structures in the Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and holomorphic vector bundles that satisfy the anomaly cancellation and slope stability conditions in E8 heterotic string compactification. This package uses functions from CYtools. For CYTools installation instructions please visit https://cy.tools. Results are published here : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21017.pdf.
