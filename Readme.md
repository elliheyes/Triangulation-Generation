# Triangulation-Generator

In this package we use a deep Q-learning reinforcement learning model to generate fine regular star triangulations of reflexive polytopes. These triangulations provide resolutions to non-terminal singularities in the ambient toric Fano variety and Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces constructed from the polytope. 

One can also look for added geometric information, such as fibration structures in the Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and holomorphic vector bundles that satisfy the anomaly cancellation and slope stability conditions in E8 heterotic string compactification.
